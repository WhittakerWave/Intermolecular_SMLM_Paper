## Description
Main Code for https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.10.593617v1

This project provides tools for performing colocalization analysis on SMLM datasets, which are used to examine the spatial relationship between different molecular species within cells. The core functions, supporting utilities, and dependencies are modularized across multiple scripts for better maintainability and reuse.

### File Overview:
- **`coloca_func.py`**: Contains the core colocalization analysis functions.
- **`coloca_run.py`**: Script to execute the main analysis function.
- **`support_func.py`**: Includes auxiliary supporting functions used in the analysis.
- **`package_func.py`**: Imports all the necessary external packages.
